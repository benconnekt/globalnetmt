The UK’s Money Laundering Regulations came in to force in March 2004</b> these regulations now ensure established reporting and record keeping procedures for UK relevant financial services, such as
   <b> First Plus</b>. These regulations also apply to <b> First Plus third party Agents</b> who are therefore required to assist in the prevention and detection of possible money laundering activities.&nbsp;

The <b> First Plus</b> Training manual is intended to assist you in understanding these laws and to help you in complying with them. Any aspect of the regulations in this manual that you do not fully understand then please do not hesitate to contact the Money Laundering officer who will be happy to assist you. It also requires
   <b> First Plus</b> to monitor and report on any unusual or suspicious foreign currency transactions of any size.
   <p>&nbsp;Please remember that the law affects <b> YOU</b> too. If you or your staff knowingly fails to report an incident or deliberately helps (e.g. by breaking down the transaction amounts) this is known as 'willful blindness' and is a legal principle that has previously been used in successful convictions. Bear this in mind with particular reference to potentially 'suspicious' transactions.&nbsp;</p>
   <p>

 

The Law also makes it an offence for anyone to provide assistance to a criminal so as to obtain, conceals invest or transfer funds, if this is done knowingly or in suspicious circumstances.&nbsp;
